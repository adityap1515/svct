                <h2>Annadanam (Narayana Seva)</h2>
                <p>Annadhaanam, as per Vedic Scriptures is considered the greatest of all “Dhaanams”. Annam (Food) is equated to Almighty God as per our Vedic scripts. Annadhanam to the needy, deserving is considered to be auspicious & is a charity of high order.</p>
                <p>As prophesied by Gurus like Sri Paramaachaarya, Vallimalai Swamigal, Bhagwan Sri Satya Sai Baba and Sadhuram Swamigal, “Annadhaanam” is the core activity of Sri Vidya Charities.</p>

                <h2>Vidyadanam</h2>
                
                <p>We in SVCT believe that no child should be deprived of the right to education. As a part of social engineering for the needy without profit motive, we have instituted ‘VIDYADANAM’, a scheme of scholarships in a humble manner of honouring, financially challenged school & college students.</p>
                <p>This financial assitance in form of a scholarship is to support the students to pursue their higher education The proposed objective is to help the meritorious students, parents, & to motivate them for better prospects & for a higher zeal.</p>

                <h2>Goshala- Go Grasa Seva </h2>
                
                <p> At Srividya Charities, we hold the sacred duty of Go Seva—caring for and protecting cows—in the highest regard. In Hindu tradition, cows are revered as symbols of purity, nourishment, and non-violence. They play a vital role in our spiritual and cultural heritage, providing us with milk, which is integral to many religious rituals and offerings. By dedicating ourselves to Go Seva, we honor this divine connection, ensuring the well-being of these gentle creatures.</p>

                    <h2>Sanskrit language and Scriptures</h2>
                    
                    <p>we are dedicated to preserving and promoting the rich heritage of Sanskrit and Vedic literatures, which are foundational to our spiritual and cultural identity. These ancient texts, including the Vedas, Upanishads, and various Sanskrit scriptures, embody profound wisdom, ethical teachings, and philosophical insights that have guided generations. By providing financial assistance to support their study, preservation, and dissemination, we ensure that this invaluable knowledge continues to enlighten future generations.</p>
